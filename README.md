# Runable on Steroid

Hi Saksham & Runable Team 👋,  

I’m **Aditya Sharma**, and this is my submission for your hiring challenge.  
It took me a few hours to build, and I’ll be honest – I leveraged AI for some functionalities because I’m really good at **prompt engineering** and why not use the resource if it's available.  

### 👨‍💻 About Me
- 💼 **Software Developer at TCS** – currently building a **quotation product from scratch**.  
- ⚡ **2 years of industry experience**, primarily as a **Backend Developer**, but also skilled in React.js for frontend, REST APIs, and Agile workflows.  
- 🌱 **Freelancer & SaaS Builder** – I’ve built multiple projects and SaaS apps outside of my job.  
- 🧠 Skilled at problem-solving, product thinking, and blending AI into workflows.  

### 🌟 Why Me?
I’d love to join **Runable** and be part of building something **homegrown at scale**.  
I enjoy working on impactful products, experimenting fast, and bringing ideas to life.
